# Exposure at Default (EAD) Calculator

## Description

This Python project calculates the **Exposure at Default (EAD)**, a key parameter in credit risk assessment. EAD represents the total exposure a financial institution faces at the time an individual or entity defaults on a loan. This calculation helps institutions assess potential losses in the event of default.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for calculating EAD in various scenarios involving credit lines, unused credit amounts, and credit conversion factors (CCF). This project is suitable for professionals working in financial institutions, credit risk analysts, or anyone looking to understand credit exposure calculation.

## Features

- Calculate EAD based on credit limit, current usage, and CCF (Credit Conversion Factor).
- Simple Python code for easy integration and use.
- Example calculation for both used and unused credit portions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TKoskas/ExposureAtDefault.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd ExposureAtDefault
```

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Calculation
For a credit limit of $100,000, where $50,000 is already used, and the credit conversion factor (CCF) is 40%, the EAD will be:


Exposure at Default (EAD): $70,000.00
